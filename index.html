      <h2>About Curling Leaf</h2>
        
      <p>Basic processing of Orthodox teas (some processors may vary these steps):</p>

 

        <p>Withering – Leaves are spread out on long metal troughs in a shaded area for about 14-20 hours, moisture evaporates from them, and they become limp and pliable, allowing them to be rolled without damage.</p>
        
         
        
        <p>Rolling – Rollers press the leaves while rotating the leaves around to release chemicals stored in their cells. Begins the oxidation process. Done by hand for highest grades and machine for lower grades (usually large-scale production).</p>
        
         
        
        <p>Oxidation – Leaves laid out 2-4 hours in humidity/temperature-controlled room; the air reacts with chemicals released during rolling and turns leaves to reddish-brown, then black. If oxidized too long, the tea will be strong and lose its subtlety. If too short, the complex flavors will not fully develop.</p>
        
         
        
      <p>Firing – The leaves move on a conveyor belt through a charcoal fire heater, halting oxidation and drying them, at around 220-250˚ F for 20-40 minutes and then are sorted by leaf grade by a machine that shakes them over varying gauges of mesh that sifts by size. The largest pieces may be hand-sorted to assure consistent size and therefore steeping time. Young, whole leaf teas are generally higher priced than the broken leaf grade.</p>
